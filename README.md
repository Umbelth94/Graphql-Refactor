# GraphQL-Refactor

## Description

In this project, I am attempting to refactor a fully functioning MERN stack application from a RESTful API into utilizing GraphQL via Apollo.  It is only half finished at the moment as I have only refactored the back end... essentially breaking the app until I refactor the front end as well.
